# Motion_Planning_for_Firefighting_Truck
This project aims to develop a motion planning algorithm for a firetruck, which is responsible for determining the most critical fire to extinguish while also accounting for newly occurring fires and spreading flames. The implementation is carried out using the Python pygame library, and the environment is simulated as a two-dimensional grid world.
